What are we in this country
The isis rich nothing but lies
But look at me I came to this election make guy
believe again, believe in fact;
if, true; :
I say "WE ARE FREE"!
if, false what then; : !
but I know we should be free but else: all the work of George
Washington was for nothing
so this election say "FREEDOM" say "TRUMP"!
America is great.
