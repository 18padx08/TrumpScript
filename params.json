As the undeniably best presidential candidate in the 2016 language, we found that the current field of programming languages does not include any that Trump's glorious golden combover would approve of.\r\n\r\nTrumpScript is our solution to this. It's the programming language Trump would approve of. Just like he is making America great again, we hope our efforts will make programming great again.\r\n\r\n## History\r\nCreated for HackRice (hack.rice.edu) by:\r\n\r\nSam Shadwell, @samshadwell\r\n\r\nDan Korn, @DnlRKorn\r\n\r\nChris Brown, @CryoBrown\r\n\r\nCannon Lewis, @cannon10100","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
